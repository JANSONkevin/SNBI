Don't use SAFARI for desktop version (cannot login). It is also advised not to use Safari with your mobil as it creates some weird interactions with the virtual keyboards and input tags (html).
It is strongly advised to use Chrome browser for admins and developpement.
To test the game on mobil, the following browsers should be used : Firefox, Opera, and lastly Chrome as because of its User Privacy policy forces a user interaction in order to start ambient musics at some point (A button is displayed when it is the case and clicking it will trigger the music and it should not be interupted for the rest of the game).

## About
